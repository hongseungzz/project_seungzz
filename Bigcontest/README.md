- Period : 2022.08.30 - 2022.10.14
- Team & Chatbot name : 선택받은아이들
- The number of Teammate : Hong Seung Gi and two others
- Field : Champion
- Main Subject : Development of Location Selection Model for Electric Vehicle Slow Charging Station in Yongin City
- Contents : Development of an index to select the location of a buffer electric vehicle charging station using the floating population, residential population, and commuting population data of a given area, and then the optimal location estimation
- Language used: ```Python```
- Tools used: ```Google Colaboratory```
- Algorithm used : ```K-means Algorithm```
- Library : ``Matplotlib```, ```Numpy```, ```Pandas```, ```Seaborn``` etc.
- Explanation
    - Simple visualization of the frequency of data on the number of electric vehicle applications run in Yongin City
    - Scatterplot implementation that varies in size and color depending on the number of applications executed by administrative district
    - Recommend optimal location through the development of K-means algorithm
